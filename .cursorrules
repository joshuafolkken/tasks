# Code Change Rules

- When you modify, add, or delete any code:
  1. You MUST run `pnpm run check` to verify type safety.
  2. You MUST run `pnpm run lint` to verify code style and quality.
  3. If any command fails, you MUST fix all reported issues.
  4. Repeat checks until they pass.
  5. Only then finish the response.

- Never say "it should pass" without actually running the commands.
- Do not end the task while errors exist.

# Git Rules

- DO NOT commit changes unless explicitly requested by the user.
