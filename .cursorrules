You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available MCP Tools:

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.

## Code Change Rules

Whenever modifying, adding, or deleting any code:

1. **Verify Type Safety**: Run `pnpm run check`.
2. **Verify Style and Quality**: Run `pnpm run lint`.
3. **Verify IDE Feedback**: ALWAYS run the **ReadLints** tool on every modified file (and any file that might be affected) before finishing. Fix all reported errors and warnings. IDE/ReadLints can report issues that terminal `pnpm run lint` does not (e.g. type resolution for generated or gitignored paths).
4. **Fix Issues**: If any check fails (terminal or IDE feedback, or ReadLints), fix all reported issues immediately.
5. **Repeat**: Repeat the checks until **all** pass and **ReadLints shows no errors** for the modified files.
6. **Completion**: Only finish the task or response after ALL checks pass and ReadLints reports **zero errors** on modified files (warnings only are acceptable only when documented as a known exception, e.g. unused eslint-disable for Paraglide).

**Constraint**: Never state "it should pass" without actually having run the commands and confirmed the output. Do not end a task while **errors** exist. Before completing, you MUST run **ReadLints** on every modified file and fix every **error** (not just rely on terminal check/lint). If verification commands fail (e.g., system error), you MUST rely on ReadLints to ensure correctness.

## Refactoring Rules

- **Prompt Reference**: When performing any refactoring, ALWAYS read and follow the instructions in `prompts/refactoring.md` before starting.

## Git Rules

- **No Commits**: DO NOT commit changes unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **Workflow Awareness**: Use `scripts/git-workflow.ts` (via `pnpm git`) when the user asks for git operations.
